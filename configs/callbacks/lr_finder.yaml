  min_lr: 1e-4 # Minimum learning rate to investigate
  max_lr: 1.0 # Maximum learning rate to investigate
  num_training_steps: 100 # Number of learning rates to test
  mode: 'exponential' # Increases the learning rate exponentially.
  early_stop_threshold: 2.0 # (Optional[float]) â€“ Threshold for stopping the search. If the loss at any point is larger than early_stop_threshold*best_loss then the search is stopped. To disable, set to None.
